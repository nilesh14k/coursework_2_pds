    "\n",
    "* Your code should make use of the functions defined above: `haversine_distance`, `effective_magnitude` and `epicenter_magnitude`. You are advised not to change these otherwise you may get different results from what the Autograder is expecting.\n",

    "* The calculation of this function is computationally intensive. For prelimiary testing you might use smaller data sets by, say only using cities in one country. \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are many optimisations that can be done to reduce the computational cost of finding the endangered cities. For example, calculating `epicenter_magnitude` enables weaker earthquakes to be ignored without the need to determine their distance from every city on earth. It may also be useful to not that when calcuating the effective magnitude of a given quake (with a specific depth) at different locations, the value always decreases as surface distance from the quake increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember that the autograder will run your actual code, so will probably take a while to grade this function. However, it only runs the function once and then performs 3 different tests on the value that is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The autograder will run on a presaved set of quakes (so the test is the same for all submissions). However, your code should run on any version of `all_day.csv` that you download from the USGS live feed."
